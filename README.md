# Elasticsearch Adapter
An Elasticsearch bridge adapter that allows [querying Elasticsearch by the URI method](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-uri-request.html)

The q parameter maps to the bridge qualification and the qualification syntax is the same as the [Query String Syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax)
